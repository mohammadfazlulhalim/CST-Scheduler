                        To get started, expand the "Administration" tab, and create Classrooms, Instructors, Programs,
                        and Terms.<br/>
                        Once those are completed, create Courses from the same "Administration" tab, which will require
                        Instructors.<br/>
                        The last thing to create in the "Administration" tab is Course Offerings, which will use
                        Courses, Terms,
                        Programs, and Instructors that you have created.<br/>
                        A big feature of this over previous CST Scheduler Applications is the idea of reusable Courses.
                        A Course is maintained between years,
                        and a Course Offering copies information from a Course, and is tied to a specific Term. So, when
                        starting a new year, the only thing
                        that needs to be recreated is Terms and Course Offerings. Terms does have an option to
                        autogenerate Course Offerings, to make this
                        even easier.<br/>

                        The next step is to hit the "Schedule Builder" tab, and select the Term, Program, and number of
                        groups you want
                        to schedule.<br/>
                        The Schedule Builder will show on the right A dropdown for Classroom and a list of Course
                        Offerings.<br/>
                        The selected classroom is which one you are currently scheduling, and can be changed for
                        different course
                        offerings within a group.<br/>
                        To schedule a course offering, click on it, so that it is selected. When a course offering is
                        selected, any cell
                        within the schedule
                        that is clicked on will schedule the selected Course Offering for that time with the classroom
                        that is also
                        selected.<br/>
                        To change an already booked Timeslot, just change your selected Course Offering and/or
                        Classroom, and click on
                        the cell that you want to change
                        and the program will edit that booked timeslot for you.<br/>
                        To delete a booked Timeslot, simply just right-click the cell. <br/>
                        The Schedule Builder automatically saves on every change, so saving your work is not
                        needed.<br/>

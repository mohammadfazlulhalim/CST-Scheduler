So, how do I want to approach coding my story?
Things to figure out:
    1. Setting up database connection properly, and testing to use in-memory as flagged in Raven's pre-code
    2. Setting up validators, start with just handling term1, then expand from there
    3. Retreiving database files in router
    4. Displaying results in HBS file
First step is to probably either get connection or validator
    - Most time efficient way would be to work on validators as other members of the group are already working on db connections
